# E-PACERR Statistical Analysis App

The E-PACERR Statistical Analysis App is a Python application built using Tkinter, Matplotlib, and Pandas. This app is designed to analyze the system usability of the E-PACERR program based on user feedback provided at the completion of each module. It follows the standard system usability scoring and provides box and whisker plots to score the user's answers, along with calculating the overall system usability score.
